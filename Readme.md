# StackTrail - AI-Guided Real-World Engineering Simulations

## 🚀 What is StackTrail?

StackTrail is an **AI-powered incident simulation platform** that trains developers to handle **real-world engineering problems**, not just algorithmic puzzles.

Instead of solving abstract data-structure problems, users face **production-like incidents** — latency spikes, CI/CD failures, security leaks, cascading outages — and must make decisions under pressure, just like in real jobs.

AI acts as a **mentor and guide**, explaining consequences, tradeoffs, and better approaches after each scenario.

## 🧠 Why StackTrail Exists

Platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces are excellent for:
- Learning algorithms
- Competitive programming
- Interview preparation

But **real engineering work is not competitive programming**.

In real life:
- Problems are ambiguous
- There is no single correct answer
- Decisions have tradeoffs
- Logs, metrics, and partial information matter
- Communication and judgment are critical

StackTrail fills this gap.

## ⚠️ The Gap in Existing Platforms

| Platform | Focus | What’s Missing |
|--------|------|----------------|
| LeetCode | Algorithms & DS | No real-world context |
| Codeforces | Competitive programming | No production scenarios |
| Interview prep tools | Pattern recognition | No decision-making |
| Tutorials | Static learning | No consequences |

**None of them simulate real incidents.**

## ✅ What StackTrail Does Differently

StackTrail focuses on **real-life engineering integration**.

- Production-style incidents
- Decision trees instead of right/wrong answers
- Logs and system behavior
- AI-generated postmortems
- Role-based scenarios

This mirrors **how engineers actually work**.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Scenario-Based Learning
- Each scenario represents a real incident
- Multiple roles:
  - Backend Engineer
  - DevOps Engineer
  - Site Reliability Engineer
  - Frontend Engineer
  - Security Engineer
- Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard

---

### 2️⃣ Branching Decision Trees
- Every choice leads to different consequences
- No visible “correct answer”
- Decisions accumulate impact over time
- Scenarios end with analysis, not scores

---

### 3️⃣ Simulated Isolated Machine (HTB-style)
- Terminal-like interface
- Realistic logs and metrics
- Commands like:
  - `top`
  - `cat logs/api.log`
  - `kubectl get pods`
- Machine state persists across steps

> Users can **investigate incidents**, not just read about them.

---

### 4️⃣ AI Mentor (Core Innovation)
- AI reviews full decision path
- Explains:
  - What worked
  - What was risky
  - What a senior engineer would do
- Generates realistic post-incident feedback
- Focuses on **learning and judgment**, not scores

---

### 5️⃣ Accessibility & Track Alignment
- Step-by-step guidance
- Low-cognitive-load design
- Works even with partial information
- Can support:
  - Local languages
  - Voice inputs
  - Offline continuation
  - SMS/WhatsApp follow-ups

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom terminal UI
- State persistence for machine simulation

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT Authentication

### AI
- Gemini API
- Prompt-engineered mentor analysis
- Context-aware feedback

### Data Model

## 🔍 Example Scenario Flow

1. Latency alert triggers
2. User inspects logs via terminal
3. Chooses investigation path
4. Applies fix
5. System stabilizes
6. AI generates postmortem
7. User learns *why* decisions mattered

This is **how real engineering works**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

StackTrail prepares users for:
- On-call rotations
- Production incidents
- System design tradeoffs
- Communication and judgment
- Real engineering responsibility

It complements algorithm platforms instead of replacing them.

---

**Built for real engineers, real incidents, and real learning.**
